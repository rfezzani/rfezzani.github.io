### rfezzani.github.io

I started writing my [resume](https://rfezzani.github.io/) as an exercice to become more familiar
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I appreciated the idea of organising my CV in a _json_ file (inspired
by [json-resume](https://jsonresume.org/)). I particularly loved the
[elegent theme](https://jsonresume.org/themes/), so I decided to adapt
it to the Jekyll/[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
framework.
